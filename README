libsoxconvolver
===============

libsoxconvolver is a DFT-based FIR filtering library based on
SoX (http://sox.sourceforge.net/).

Difference from libsox:
  - Only containes FIR filter, plus lowpass filter designer.
  - 32bit float based.
  - Use PFFFT (https://bitbucket.org/jpommier/pffft/) for DFT when SSE is
    available
  - Different API.

How to build (Unix)
-------------------
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure && make
$ sudo make install

How to build (Windows)
----------------------
MSVC project (for Visual Studio 2010) is included.

Note
----
ooura's fft4g and PFFFT are dynamically dispatched at runtime by checking
SSE availability.
configure with option "--disable-simd" just kills this dispatch, and 
makes libsoxconvolver pick ooura's implementation even when SSE is available.
